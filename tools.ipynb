[...] According to a Deloitte survey of over 700 senior leaders in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom conducted in June 2024, there was a significant increase over the previous six months in respondents reporting that their organizations are highly prepared or very highly prepared to adopt gen AI in the areas of strategy (up 11 percentage points since December 2023), technology and infrastructure (up 9 percentage points), and talent (up 8 percentage points). [...] The latest wave of Deloitte’s State of Generative AI in the Enterprise survey also found that Europe-based respondents are focusing less on gen AI’s short-term operational use cases such as reducing costs (down 8 percentage points since December 2023) or improving efficiency and productivity (down 4 percentage points), and instead are turning their attention to applications that can help them gain a longer-term competitive advantage and secure strategic benefits. For example, more respondents', tool_call_id='web_search'), ToolMessage(content='What is clear is that AI adoption in Europe is low and likely running behind other parts of the world. Discussions on the barriers to AI advancement often mix up different stages of innovation – research, development and adoption. Each stage is constrained by the availability of skills, data and financing in the European market, but there are nuances in how these barriers arise in each of the three stages. [...] Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a key driver of future economic development, expected to increase labour productivity and economic growth worldwide. To realise these gains, AI technologies need to be adopted by companies and integrated into their operations. However, it is unclear what the current level of AI adoption by European firms actually is. Estimates vary widely because of uneven data collection and lack of a standard definition and taxonomy of AI. [...] To accelerate the roll-out of AI technology across the European Union, policymakers should alleviate constraints to adoption faced by firms, both in the environmental context – labour market, financial market and regulation – and in the technological context – data availability, basic digitisation of businesses and technological uncertainty.', tool_call_id='web_search'), ToolMessage(content=\"As AI reshapes the global economy, Europe faces a crucial moment. The past year has witnessed widespread adoption of AI, popularised by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), with our research suggesting Europe could achieve near-universal business adoption of AI by 2030. [...] This report reveals that Europe is at a critical juncture. While businesses and citizens show growing enthusiasm for AI's potential, startups are ahead in driving innovation and business transformation with AI. In contrast, larger companies remain primarily focused on early experimentation and the lowest-hanging fruit of efficiency gains at the expense of deeper adoption. This divergence risks creating a two-tier AI economy that could limit Europe's potential to leverage the benefits of digital [...] \\u200b\\n\\nOur research draws on independent studies conducted by Strand Partners, encompassing over 15,000 citizens and 15,000 businesses across the European Union, UK, and Switzerland.

Given the technology’s novelty, the adoption race remains wide open. Europe has numerous opportunities to tactically reinforce its positions along the value chain while ensuring that it guides gen AI development by ethical considerations. Policy makers must understand that the stakes here are considerable and extend beyond immediate economic impacts. Europe’s participation in the current AI boom is important [...] *   **A three-lens approach–on adoption, creation, and energy–is required to assess Europe’s competitiveness in the emerging generative AI (gen AI) economy.** While much of the current discourse centers around large language models (LLMs), European policy makers and business leaders must look beyond LLMs. Adopting a holistic approach to capitalize fully on gen AI’s potential could boost European labor productivity by up to 3 percent annually through 2030.', tool_call_id='web_search'), ToolMessage(content=\"For governments, secure adoption of the technology, responsible AI education, and continued investment in skill-building through public-private partnerships are all critical priorities.\\n\\n**The European AI Opportunity**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nEurope has strong foundations for AI success — robust research capabilities, strong institutions, innovative startups, and public sector adoption.

[...] According to a Deloitte survey of over 700 senior leaders in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom conducted in June 2024, there was a significant increase over the previous six months in respondents reporting that their organizations are highly prepared or very highly prepared to adopt gen AI in the areas of strategy (up 11 percentage points since December 2023), technology and infrastructure (up 9 percentage points), and talent (up 8 percentage points). [...] The latest wave of Deloitte’s State of Generative AI in the Enterprise survey also found that Europe-based respondents are focusing less on gen AI’s short-term operational use cases such as reducing costs (down 8 percentage points since December 2023) or improving efficiency and productivity (down 4 percentage points), and instead are turning their attention to applications that can help them gain a longer-term competitive advantage and secure strategic benefits.
